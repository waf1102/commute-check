# Subagent-Driven Development

Execute plan by dispatching fresh subagent per task, with two-stage review after each: spec compliance review first, then code quality review.

**Why subagents:** You delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused and succeed at their task. They should never inherit your session's context or history — you construct exactly what they need. This also preserves your own context for coordination work.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + two-stage review (spec then quality) = high quality, fast iteration

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner between tasks. Execute all tasks from the plan without stopping. The only reasons to stop are: BLOCKED status you cannot resolve, ambiguity that genuinely prevents progress, or all tasks complete. "Should I continue?" prompts and progress summaries waste their time — they asked you to execute the plan, so execute it.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Have implementation plan?" [shape=diamond];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" [shape=diamond];
    "subagent-driven-development" [shape=box];
    "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [shape=box];

    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Tasks mostly independent?" [label="yes"];
    "Have implementation plan?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "subagent-driven-development" [label="yes"];
    "Tasks mostly independent?" -> "Manual execution or brainstorm first" [label="no - tightly coupled"];
}
```

Plans come from **superpowers:writing-plans**. This skill executes one.

## The Process

```dot
digraph process {
    rankdir=TB;

    subgraph cluster_per_task {
        label="Per Task";
        "invoke_subagent TypeName: implementer" [shape=box];
        "Implementer subagent asks questions?" [shape=diamond];
        "Answer questions, provide context" [shape=box];
        "Implementer subagent implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" [shape=box];
        "invoke_subagent TypeName: spec-reviewer" [shape=box];
        "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?" [shape=diamond];
        "invoke_subagent TypeName: code-reviewer" [shape=box];
        "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" [shape=diamond];
        "Fix loop (spec): resume implementer, scoped re-review (max 5 rounds/task)" [shape=box];
        "Fix loop (quality): resume implementer, scoped re-review (max 5 rounds/task)" [shape=box];
        "Update task.md artifact" [shape=box];
    }

    "Read plan, extract all tasks, create task.md artifact" [shape=box];
    "More tasks remain?" [shape=diamond];
    "Dispatch final code reviewer subagent for entire implementation" [shape=box];
    "Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch" [shape=box style=filled fillcolor=lightgreen];

    "Read plan, extract all tasks, create task.md artifact" -> "invoke_subagent TypeName: implementer";
    "invoke_subagent TypeName: implementer" -> "Implementer subagent asks questions?";
    "Implementer subagent asks questions?" -> "Answer questions, provide context" [label="yes"];
    "Answer questions, provide context" -> "invoke_subagent TypeName: implementer";
    "Implementer subagent asks questions?" -> "Implementer subagent implements, tests, commits, self-reviews" [label="no"];

    "invoke_subagent TypeName: spec-reviewer" -> "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?";
    "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?" -> "Fix loop (spec): resume implementer, scoped re-review (max 5 rounds/task)" [label="no"];
    "Fix loop (spec): resume implementer, scoped re-review (max 5 rounds/task)" -> "Spec reviewer subagent confirms code matches spec?" [label="round clean"];

    "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" -> "Fix loop (quality): resume implementer, scoped re-review (max 5 rounds/task)" [label="no"];
    "Fix loop (quality): resume implementer, scoped re-review (max 5 rounds/task)" -> "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" [label="round clean"];
    "Code quality reviewer subagent approves?" -> "Update task.md artifact" [label="yes"];
    "Update task.md artifact" -> "More tasks remain?";
    "More tasks remain?" -> "invoke_subagent TypeName: implementer" [label="yes"];
    "More tasks remain?" -> "Dispatch final code reviewer subagent for entire implementation" [label="no"];
    "Dispatch final code reviewer subagent for entire implementation" -> "Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch";
}
```

## Setup

1. Ensure an isolated workspace: use superpowers:using-git-worktrees to create one or verify the existing one

**Never:**
- Start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

- At skill start, resolve this plan's workspace:
  `<repo-root>/.superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>/` (plan filename without
  `.md`). Create it and the self-ignore rule in one command:
  `mkdir -p .superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename> && printf '*\n' > .superpowers/.gitignore`

Then open the ledger:

- If `progress.md` exists in this plan's directory, read it — tasks it marks complete are DONE; resume at the first task not marked complete.
- If it does not exist, create it now with its header line: `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`.

The four roles ship as bundled agents — `implementer`, `spec-reviewer`,
`code-reviewer`, `re-reviewer` (defined in the plugin's `agents/`
directory). No registration step: dispatch them by TypeName. If a dispatch
fails with an unknown TypeName, the plugin's agents are not being
discovered — verify the plugin installation before working around it.

**Workspace isolation per role:**

| Role | Workspace Mode | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Implementer | `Workspace: "branch"` | Needs isolated write access |
| Spec reviewer | `Workspace: "inherit"` | Read-only — only inspects code |
| Code reviewer | `Workspace: "inherit"` | Read-only — only inspects code |
| Re-reviewer | `Workspace: "inherit"` | Read-only — verifies the fix diff |

Read the plan once, extract all tasks with full text and context, and
create a `task.md` artifact tracking each task's status.

### Pre-Flight Plan Review

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a
  defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic block)

Present everything you find to your human partner as one batched question —
each finding beside the plan text that mandates it, asking which governs —
before execution begins, not one interrupt per discovery mid-plan. If the
scan is clean, proceed without comment. The review loop remains the net for
conflicts that only emerge from implementation.

## Model Selection

Model tiers are set in each agent file's frontmatter (`model: flash|pro|inherit`). The four bundled roles live in the plugin's `agents/` directory and all ship `model: inherit` — the session's model governs. To differentiate tiers, add a workspace-scoped variant at `.agents/agents/<name>.md` first — this is the primary escalation path — or edit the plugin's bundled agent files directly; editing plugin (or global) agent files may require the user's Agent Non-Workspace File Access setting to be enabled. Neither `define_subagent` nor `invoke_subagent` takes a model argument.

Use the least powerful tier that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (isolated functions, clear specs, 1-2 files): use a flash-tier agent type. Most implementation tasks are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, pattern matching, debugging): use a standard model.

**Architecture, design, and review tasks**: use a pro-tier agent type.

**Task complexity signals:**
- Touches 1-2 files with a complete spec → flash-tier agent type
- Touches multiple files with integration concerns → standard model
- Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding → pro-tier agent type

## The Task Loop

For each task, in plan order:

1. Fill `implementer-prompt.md`'s dynamic template with the task's full text and scene-setting context, then dispatch: `invoke_subagent(Subagents: [{TypeName: "implementer", Role: "Implement Task <N>", Prompt: <filled template>, Workspace: "branch"}])`.
2. **Record the implementer's conversation ID and its task branch name from the dispatch result** — the fix loop and the ledger's commit range depend on both.
3. When the implementer reports DONE, run the two review stages in order: `spec-reviewer` first, then `code-reviewer` (dispatch templates in Prompt Templates below). Findings from either stage enter The Fix Loop.

**Never:**
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make subagent read plan file (provide full text instead)
- **Start code quality review before spec compliance is ✅** (wrong order)

### Handling Implementer Status

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Proceed to spec compliance review.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Send the missing context via `send_message` — the idle implementer resumes with its context intact.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, resume or re-dispatch with more context
2. If the task requires more reasoning, raise the agent's tier — add a workspace-scoped variant at `.agents/agents/<name>.md` first, or edit the bundled agent's frontmatter to `model: pro` (may require Agent Non-Workspace File Access) — and re-dispatch
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the user

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same agent to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

**Terminal error:** if `manage_subagents` `Action: "list"` shows the subagent in an error state (terminal failure — distinct from idle), it cannot be resumed; treat it as killed: dispatch a fresh implementer with the task text and the last known state.

### Constructing Reviewer Prompts

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the
final whole-branch review. When you fill a reviewer template:

- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a
  false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review
  loop. If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag," "don't treat X
  as a defect," "at most Minor," or "the plan chose" — stop: you are
  pre-judging, usually to spare yourself a review loop.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention lens.
  Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global Constraints
  section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the stated
  relationships between components.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- Spec-compliance failures (from the spec-reviewer) are always blocking —
  the implementer must fix them before proceeding to code quality review.
  The severity triage above (Critical/Important/Minor) applies to the
  code-quality reviewer's findings.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with what
  the plan's text requires — is the human's decision: present the finding
  and the plan text, ask which governs. Do not dismiss the finding because
  the plan mandates it, and do not dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan
  without asking.
- When a later dispatch touches an area with a parked finding, carry a
  one-line pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch prompt.

### The Fix Loop

When either reviewer returns findings, the same loop runs regardless of
stage. **Record the implementer's conversation ID at dispatch time — the
loop depends on it.**

**Rounds 1–3 — resume the implementer.** `send_message` the open findings
verbatim to the implementer's conversation. The idle implementer re-awakens
with its full context — the task, the code it wrote, its test knowledge —
and fixes without re-reading anything. Every fix reply must name the
covering tests it re-ran and show their results; do not dispatch the
re-review until it does. Record Minor findings in the ledger as you go
(`Task N: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`) and point the final whole-branch
review at that list — a roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard.

**Every round ends with a scoped re-review.** Dispatch the `re-reviewer`
(see `re-review-prompt.md`) with the findings and the fix range. It
verdicts each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and checks only the fix
diff for new breakage — it cannot wander into a fresh full review.
Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger, never back into the loop.

**Rounds 4–5 — fresh implementer, takeover framing.** If three resumed
rounds haven't converged, the original implementer's approach may be the
problem. Kill it (`manage_subagents`), dispatch a fresh `implementer`
whose Prompt carries: the task text, the prior implementer's last report,
and the open findings. Its first action is `git checkout <task-branch>` in
its workspace so it continues the task's commits rather than starting
over.

**Round counting is shared per task, across both stages.** Append
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<stage>: <one-line summary>)` to the ledger
each round.

**At the cap — adjudicate.** After round 5, stop dispatching. For each
open finding, rule:
- **Contested** (implementer and reviewer disagree on whether it's real) —
  park it: ledger the finding and your ruling.
- **Real but not load-bearing** for this task — park it the same way; the
  final review triages it.
- **Real and load-bearing** — the task is BLOCKED: stop and present it to
  your human partner with both positions.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Never fix findings yourself in the controller
session — controller fixes pollute your context and skip review.

## Async Operations

### Background Task Management

When implementers run long-running operations (builds, test suites, deployments), use `manage_task` instead of blocking:

**For operations expected to take >30 seconds:**
- Implementer should use `run_command` with a short `WaitMsBeforeAsync` (e.g., 500ms) to background it
- Check completion with `manage_task` `Action: "status"`, paced by a `schedule` timer rather than a tight loop
- Use `manage_task` with `kill` to terminate stuck processes

**When to background vs. wait:**

```dot
digraph background_decision {
    "Operation expected >30s?" [shape=diamond];
    "Background with manage_task" [shape=box];
    "Wait synchronously" [shape=box];

    "Operation expected >30s?" -> "Background with manage_task" [label="yes"];
    "Operation expected >30s?" -> "Wait synchronously" [label="no"];
}
```

### Agent Communication

Use `send_message` to communicate with subagents — running or idle. An idle (finished, not killed or errored) subagent re-awakens on receipt and retains its full context.

**Answering questions mid-flight:**
- When an implementer asks a question, use `send_message` with the implementer's conversation ID — this works whether it's still running or has gone idle
- Don't re-dispatch a new subagent just to answer a question — the original implementer has context

**Providing additional context:**
- If you realize an implementer needs more information after dispatch, use `send_message` to send it
- The implementer receives it as a message and can incorporate it into their work

**When to use `send_message` vs. re-dispatch:**
- Subagent (running or idle) needs info → `send_message` — an idle subagent resumes with its context intact
- Subagent reported NEEDS_CONTEXT → send the missing context via `send_message`; re-dispatch a fresh subagent only if the original was killed or in an error state
- Subagent reported BLOCKED → assess blocker, possibly resume with more context via `send_message`, break the task into smaller pieces, or dispatch a more capable custom agent type

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

### Timeout Protection

Use `schedule` as a safety net for complex tasks:

```dot
digraph timeout {
    "Dispatch implementer" [shape=box];
    "Set one-shot timer" [shape=box];
    "Timer fires" [shape=box];
    "Implementer already responded?" [shape=diamond];
    "Treat as no-op reminder, move on" [shape=box];
    "Check subagent status and intervene" [shape=box];

    "Dispatch implementer" -> "Set one-shot timer";
    "Set one-shot timer" -> "Timer fires" [label="wait"];
    "Timer fires" -> "Implementer already responded?";
    "Implementer already responded?" -> "Treat as no-op reminder, move on" [label="yes"];
    "Implementer already responded?" -> "Check subagent status and intervene" [label="no"];
}
```

- Set a one-shot timer when dispatching implementers for complex tasks (5 minutes for standard tasks, 10 for complex ones)
- If the timer fires before the implementer responds, check status and intervene if needed
- The timer's Prompt fires unconditionally at the scheduled time — if the implementer already responded, treat the firing as a no-op reminder and move on; no cancellation is documented or needed

**For test suites expected to take 5+ minutes**, use a recurring schedule instead of a one-shot timer:
```
schedule(CronExpression: "*/2 * * * *", MaxIterations: "5", Prompt: "Check implementer status for Task N")
```

### Subagent Monitoring

Use `manage_subagents` to track running subagents:

- `Action: "list"` — check which subagents are still running before dispatching the next task
- `Action: "kill"` — terminate stuck subagents that haven't responded after timeout

Don't poll in a loop — the system notifies you when subagents complete. Use `manage_subagents` only when you need an explicit status check (e.g., before cleanup or when a timer fires).

## Durable Progress

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. In real sessions, controllers
that lost their place have re-dispatched entire completed task sequences — the
single most expensive failure observed. Track progress in a ledger file, not
only in todos.

- The ledger is `progress.md` inside this plan's workspace directory (resolved in Setup). Its first line names
  the plan: `# SDD ledger — plan: <plan file path>`. A ledger whose first
  line names a different plan — or a stray ledger at the old flat
  `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md` — is another plan's progress: leave it and
  start fresh.
- Tasks listed in this plan's ledger as complete are DONE — do not
  re-dispatch them; resume at the first task not marked complete.
- When a task's review comes back clean, append one line to the ledger in
  the same message as your other bookkeeping:
  `Task N: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`.
- The ledger is your recovery map: the commits it names exist in git even
  when your context no longer remembers creating them. After compaction,
  trust the ledger and `git log` over your own recollection.
- `git clean -fdx` will destroy the ledger (it's git-ignored scratch); if
  that happens, recover from `git log`.

## Final Review

After all tasks are complete, dispatch a final code-reviewer subagent for
the entire implementation — the one whole-branch review that per-task
reviews don't cover.

- If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix
  subagent with the complete findings list — not one fixer per finding —
  followed by exactly ONE scoped re-review of the fix wave. Residual
  findings after that are adjudicated, not looped.

## Finish

- When the final whole-branch review is clean, delete this plan's
  directory (`rm -rf .superpowers/sdd/<plan-basename>`) — git history is
  the durable record. Leave sibling plan directories alone.

Then hand off to **superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch** to complete
the branch.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Close enough on spec compliance" | Reviewer found spec gaps = not done. Fix or hit the cap and adjudicate — those are the only exits. |
| "I'll fix it myself, dispatching is overhead" | Controller fixes pollute your context and skip review. Resume the implementer with `send_message`. |
| "One more round will converge" | Past the cap, rounds don't converge — the failure is structural. Adjudicate and route. |
| "The reviewer will just find something new anyway" | Scoped re-reviews verify fixes; they cannot wander. New findings on untouched code go to the ledger, not the loop. |
| "This finding is obviously wrong, I'll drop it" | You adjudicate only at the cap, and every ruling is a ledger entry. Silent discards are forbidden. |
| "The fix was small, skip the re-review" | Unreviewed fixes are how regressions land. Every round ends with a scoped re-review. |
| "Reviews slow the loop down" | The loop without reviews is just unverified churn. Reviews are the loop's brakes and steering. |
| "Ledger bookkeeping is overhead" | The ledger is what survives compaction. Controllers without one have re-dispatched entire completed task sequences. |

## Prompt Templates

- `implementer-prompt.md` (located in the `subagent-driven-development` skill directory) — dynamic dispatch template — the static role lives in `agents/implementer.md`
- `spec-reviewer-prompt.md` (located in the `subagent-driven-development` skill directory) — dynamic dispatch template — the static role lives in `agents/spec-reviewer.md`
- `code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md` (located in the `subagent-driven-development` skill directory) — dynamic dispatch template — the static role lives in `agents/code-reviewer.md`
- `re-review-prompt.md` (located in the `subagent-driven-development` skill directory) — dynamic dispatch template — the static role lives in `agents/re-reviewer.md`
- `code-reviewer.md` (located in the `requesting-code-review` skill directory) — dynamic dispatch template — the static role lives in `agents/code-reviewer.md`
